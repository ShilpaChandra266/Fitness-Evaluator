# Fitness-Evaluator
A web based application “Fitness Evaluator”, is based on the belief that the Fitbit data can be a great asset in assessing the health. However, we determined that for a layman, it’s easier if this data is visualized in simple graphs and charts. A pictorial representation of data acts as a comprehensive visual aid for any novice person. That’s the power of visualization.
Our aim is to use available libraries for plotting graphs and charts to view the data from Fitbit so that the data becomes more meaningful to the user. Anyone with a Fitbit device can use our application to project their data. All you need is your Fitbit user name and password. Below is a diagram explaining the working of Fitness Evaluator.
